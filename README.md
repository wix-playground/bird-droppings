### Interactive Google Map with KML layer

#### Features
* Google Map created with a KMZ file to create a KML layer.
* Search bar biased to the defined service region.
* Selecting a search location adds a marker on the map. Previous search location markers are deleted (this code can be deleted to allow multiple markers).

#### To use the map
* At the end of the html-map.html file, replace the string API_KEY with a valid Google API key.
* Copy the code (with the API key) from the html-map.html file into an HtmlComponent.
* The user should create a repository for the sang-service-map.kmz file, and the path should be changed in the map's HTML code.
